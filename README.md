# Designer Starter Pack
Interactive Figma skill map to keep track of resources and progress, that reflect industry expectations for beginner and intermediate learners

### What is Designer Starter Pack?
Designer Starter Pack is a curated list of useful skills for working with Figma, with recommended resources. It's currently limited at this definitive list of skills. 

### How does it work? 
The skills are ordered according to the amount of prior experience required, from Basics to Advanced. Hover over each skill to see the recommended resources list. Feel free to add your own resources! There are so many good ones â€“ from tutorials that introduce the tool broadly to detailed guides that apply to a niche problem. To keep track of skills that you know, you can mark them as completed. Once you complete a category of skills, you collect a sticker :rainbow:

### How did you choose the skills?
As a product designer at a lean product startup, I have been bringing my non-designer colleagues closer to the product development process via Figma. Simply teaching people how to navigate a page or prototype and add their comments benefits the entire team. Through my experiences developing and conducting Figma workshops for Friends of Figma Singapore, Tech For She, Padang.Co, and at Funding Societies, I've become more aware of how different beginners learn.

###### RESOURCES MODALS TO BE MORE MOBILE-FRIENDLY
Although it is sized for mobile, there is a lot of room for improvement to manage users expectations while interacting with the resource modals.

###### EDITING RESOURCES
Ability to remove resources. Currently users can only add resources.

###### ADDING FAVICONS & EMOJIS
As the list of resources grows, iconography serves as helpful visual anchors and are also delightful :) 

###### KEEPING DSP UP-TO-DATE
Figma as a design tool changes very quickly. Auto-Layout 3.0, interactive components, and variants (all launched Sep 2020) are game-changing features. I hope to update the skill and resources list to reflect these additions.
